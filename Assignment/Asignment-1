Html is Known as Hyper text markup language that is used for the Structure of a Webpage and its content .

2.Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
No, HTML tags and HTML elements are not the same thing

HTML Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML and are used to define the start and end of an element. They are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). For example, <p> is an opening tag for a paragraph, and </p> is the closing tag. 

HTML Elements: Elements are the actual objects or structures in the document created using tags. An element consists of an opening tag, its content (if any), and a closing tag (if applicable). For example, the entire structure <p>This is a paragraph.</p> is an HTML element. It includes the opening tag <p>, the content "This is a paragraph.", and the closing tag </p>.

Tag = Just the part in < >
Element = The tag(s) + the content inside.


3.What are the tags and attributes in HTML?

Tags are used to define elements in an HTML document. They specify how content should be structured or presented in a web browser.

Opening Tag: The starting point of an element, enclosed in angle brackets (<>).
Closing Tag: The ending point of an element, often the same as the opening tag but with a / before the tag name.
<p> is the opening tag for a paragraph.
</p> is the closing tag for the paragraph.
ex-
<div>  
<img>
<h1>

<div id="header"></div>


4.What are void elements in HTML?
Void elements in HTML, also known as self-closing elements, are elements that do not have any content and therefore do not require a closing tag. They are used for inserting elements that do not need to contain other HTML elements or text, such as line breaks, images

6.Diff between HTML vs XHTML?
HTML: 
1.lenient in terms of syntax
2.Can be written with different versions ( HTML5), and the document type declaration (Doctype) varies based on the version.
3.Tag and attribute names are not case-sensitive, so you can use either lowercase or uppercase, though lowercase is more common for readability.
4.Certain tags (like <img>, <br>, and <input>) don’t need to be closed, making HTML less strict about closing tags.

XHTML:
1.Stricter syntax (must follow XML rules)
2.Must follow a more specific XML-based DTD
3.Tag and attribute names are case-sensitive and must be in lowercase
4.All tags must be properly closed. Self-closing tags require a trailing slash (/)
